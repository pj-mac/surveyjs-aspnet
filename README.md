# Example of survey created using SurveyJS and .NET

SurveyJS provides building blocks that you can use to implement a self-hosted survey and form service.
Your users will be able to create surveys and forms, run them, store results in your database, and analyze them.

This repository contains an example of using SurveyJS in a .NET application. The survey definition is stored in JSON 
format which is then rendered as HTML using the SurveyJS library. The survey results (also JSON) can be then be stored 
in a custom database.
